Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and
high-quality triangular meshes.  The latter can be generated with no small
or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.  If no
command line switch is specified, your .node input file is read, and the
Delaunay triangulation is returned in .node and .ele output files.  The
command syntax is:

triangle [-prq__a__uAcDjevngBPNEIOXzo_YS__iFlsCQVh] input_file

Underscores indicate that numbers may optionally follow certain switches.
Do not leave any space between a switch and its numeric parameter.
input_file must be a file with extension .node, or extension .poly if the
-p switch is used.  If -r is used, you must supply .node and .ele files,
and possibly a .poly file and an .area file as well.  The formats of these
files are described below.

Command Line Switches:

    -p  Reads a Planar Straight Line Graph (.poly file), which can specify
        vertices, segments, holes, regional attributes, and regional area
        constraints.  Generates a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT)
        fitting the input; or, if -s, -q, -a, or -u is used, a conforming
        constrained Delaunay triangulation (CCDT).  If you want a truly
        Delaunay (not just constrained Delaunay) triangulation, use -D as
        well.  When -p is not used, Triangle reads a .node file by default.
    -r  Refines a previously generated mesh.  The mesh is read from a .node
        file and an .ele file.  If -p is also used, a .poly file is read
        and used to constrain segments in the mesh.  If -a is also used
        (with no number following), an .area file is read and used to
        impose area constraints on the mesh.  Further details on refinement
        appear below.
    -q  Quality mesh generation by Delaunay refinement (a hybrid of Paul
        Chew&#39;s and Jim Ruppert&#39;s algorithms).  Adds vertices to the mesh to
        ensure that all angles are between 20 and 140 degrees.  An
        alternative bound on the minimum angle, replacing 20 degrees, may
        be specified after the `q&#39;.  The specified angle may include a
        decimal point, but not exponential notation.  Note that a bound of
        theta degrees on the smallest angle also implies a bound of
        (180 - 2 theta) on the largest angle.  If the minimum angle is 28.6
        degrees or smaller, Triangle is mathematically guaranteed to
        terminate (assuming infinite precision arithmetic--Triangle may
        fail to terminate if you run out of precision).  In practice,
        Triangle often succeeds for minimum angles up to 34 degrees.  For
        some meshes, however, you might need to reduce the minimum angle to
        avoid problems associated with insufficient floating-point
        precision.
    -a  Imposes a maximum triangle area.  If a number follows the `a&#39;, no
        triangle is generated whose area is larger than that number.  If no
        number is specified, an .area file (if -r is used) or .poly file
        (if -r is not used) specifies a set of maximum area constraints.
        An .area file contains a separate area constraint for each
        triangle, and is useful for refining a finite element mesh based on
        a posteriori error estimates.  A .poly file can optionally contain
        an area constraint for each segment-bounded region, thereby
        controlling triangle densities in a first triangulation of a PSLG.
        You can impose both a fixed area constraint and a varying area
        constraint by invoking the -a switch twice, once with and once
        without a number following.  Each area specified may include a
        decimal point.
    -u  Imposes a user-defined constraint on triangle size.  There are two
        ways to use this feature.  One is to edit the triunsuitable()
        procedure in triangle.c to encode any constraint you like, then
        recompile Triangle.  The other is to compile triangle.c with the
        EXTERNAL_TEST symbol set (compiler switch -DEXTERNAL_TEST), then
        link Triangle with a separate object file that implements
        triunsuitable().  In either case, the -u switch causes the user-
        defined test to be applied to every triangle.
    -A  Assigns an additional floating-point attribute to each triangle
        that identifies what segment-bounded region each triangle belongs
        to.  Attributes are assigned to regions by the .poly file.  If a
        region is not explicitly marked by the .poly file, triangles in
        that region are assigned an attribute of zero.  The -A switch has
        an effect only when the -p switch is used and the -r switch is not.
    -c  Creates segments on the convex hull of the triangulation.  If you
        are triangulating a vertex set, this switch causes a .poly file to
        be written, containing all edges of the convex hull.  If you are
        triangulating a PSLG, this switch specifies that the whole convex
        hull of the PSLG should be triangulated, regardless of what
        segments the PSLG has.  If you do not use this switch when
        triangulating a PSLG, Triangle assumes that you have identified the
        region to be triangulated by surrounding it with segments of the
        input PSLG.  Beware:  if you are not careful, this switch can cause
        the introduction of an extremely thin angle between a PSLG segment
        and a convex hull segment, which can cause overrefinement (and
        possibly failure if Triangle runs out of precision).  If you are
        refining a mesh, the -c switch works differently:  it causes a
        .poly file to be written containing the boundary edges of the mesh
        (useful if no .poly file was read).
    -D  Conforming Delaunay triangulation:  use this switch if you want to
        ensure that all the triangles in the mesh are Delaunay, and not
        merely constrained Delaunay; or if you want to ensure that all the
        Voronoi vertices lie within the triangulation.  (Some finite volume
        methods have this requirement.)  This switch invokes Ruppert&#39;s
        original algorithm, which splits every subsegment whose diametral
        circle is encroached.  It usually increases the number of vertices
        and triangles.
    -j  Jettisons vertices that are not part of the final triangulation
        from the output .node file.  By default, Triangle copies all
        vertices in the input .node file to the output .node file, in the
        same order, so their indices do not change.  The -j switch prevents
        duplicated input vertices, or vertices `eaten&#39; by holes, from
        appearing in the output .node file.  Thus, if two input vertices
        have exactly the same coordinates, only the first appears in the
        output.  If any vertices are jettisoned, the vertex numbering in
        the output .node file differs from that of the input .node file.
    -e  Outputs (to an .edge file) a list of edges of the triangulation.
    -v  Outputs the Voronoi diagram associated with the triangulation.
        Does not attempt to detect degeneracies, so some Voronoi vertices
        may be duplicated.  See the discussion of Voronoi diagrams below.
    -n  Outputs (to a .neigh file) a list of triangles neighboring each
        triangle.
    -g  Outputs the mesh to an Object File Format (.off) file, suitable for
        viewing with the Geometry Center&#39;s Geomview package.
    -B  No boundary markers in the output .node, .poly, and .edge output
        files.  See the detailed discussion of boundary markers below.
    -P  No output .poly file.  Saves disk space, but you lose the ability
        to maintain constraining segments on later refinements of the mesh.
    -N  No output .node file.
    -E  No output .ele file.
    -I  No iteration numbers.  Suppresses the output of .node and .poly
        files, so your input files won&#39;t be overwritten.  (If your input is
        a .poly file only, a .node file is written.)  Cannot be used with
        the -r switch, because that would overwrite your input .ele file.
        Shouldn&#39;t be used with the -q, -a, -u, or -s switch if you are
        using a .node file for input, because no .node file is written, so
        there is no record of any added Steiner points.
    -O  No holes.  Ignores the holes in the .poly file.
    -X  No exact arithmetic.  Normally, Triangle uses exact floating-point
        arithmetic for certain tests if it thinks the inexact tests are not
        accurate enough.  Exact arithmetic ensures the robustness of the
        triangulation algorithms, despite floating-point roundoff error.
        Disabling exact arithmetic with the -X switch causes a small
        improvement in speed and creates the possibility that Triangle will
        fail to produce a valid mesh.  Not recommended.
    -z  Numbers all items starting from zero (rather than one).  Note that
        this switch is normally overridden by the value used to number the
        first vertex of the input .node or .poly file.  However, this
        switch is useful when calling Triangle from another program.
    -o2 Generates second-order subparametric elements with six nodes each.
    -Y  No new vertices on the boundary.  This switch is useful when the
        mesh boundary must be preserved so that it conforms to some
        adjacent mesh.  Be forewarned that you will probably sacrifice much
        of the quality of the mesh; Triangle will try, but the resulting
        mesh may contain poorly shaped triangles.  Works well if all the
        boundary vertices are closely spaced.  Specify this switch twice
        (`-YY&#39;) to prevent all segment splitting, including internal
        boundaries.
    -S  Specifies the maximum number of Steiner points (vertices that are
        not in the input, but are added to meet the constraints on minimum
        angle and maximum area).  The default is to allow an unlimited
        number.  If you specify this switch with no number after it,
        the limit is set to zero.  Triangle always adds vertices at segment
        intersections, even if it needs to use more vertices than the limit
        you set.  When Triangle inserts segments by splitting (-s), it
        always adds enough vertices to ensure that all the segments of the
        PLSG are recovered, ignoring the limit if necessary.
    -i  Uses an incremental rather than a divide-and-conquer algorithm to
        construct a Delaunay triangulation.  Try it if the divide-and-
        conquer algorithm fails.
    -F  Uses Steven Fortune&#39;s sweepline algorithm to construct a Delaunay
        triangulation.  Warning:  does not use exact arithmetic for all
        calculations.  An exact result is not guaranteed.
    -l  Uses only vertical cuts in the divide-and-conquer algorithm.  By
        default, Triangle alternates between vertical and horizontal cuts,
        which usually improve the speed except with vertex sets that are
        small or short and wide.  This switch is primarily of theoretical
        interest.
    -s  Specifies that segments should be forced into the triangulation by
        recursively splitting them at their midpoints, rather than by
        generating a constrained Delaunay triangulation.  Segment splitting
        is true to Ruppert&#39;s original algorithm, but can create needlessly
        small triangles.  This switch is primarily of theoretical interest.
    -C  Check the consistency of the final mesh.  Uses exact arithmetic for
        checking, even if the -X switch is used.  Useful if you suspect
        Triangle is buggy.
    -Q  Quiet:  Suppresses all explanation of what Triangle is doing,
        unless an error occurs.
    -V  Verbose:  Gives detailed information about what Triangle is doing.
        Add more `V&#39;s for increasing amount of detail.  `-V&#39; is most
        useful; itgives information on algorithmic progress and much more
        detailed statistics.  `-VV&#39; gives vertex-by-vertex details, and
        prints so much that Triangle runs much more slowly.  `-VVVV&#39; gives
        information only a debugger could love.
    -h  Help:  Displays these instructions.

Definitions:

  A Delaunay triangulation of a vertex set is a triangulation whose
  vertices are the vertex set, that covers the convex hull of the vertex
  set.  A Delaunay triangulation has the property that no vertex lies
  inside the circumscribing circle (circle that passes through all three
  vertices) of any triangle in the triangulation.

  A Voronoi diagram of a vertex set is a subdivision of the plane into
  polygonal cells (some of which may be unbounded, meaning infinitely
  large), where each cell is the set of points in the plane that are closer
  to some input vertex than to any other input vertex.  The Voronoi diagram
  is a geometric dual of the Delaunay triangulation.

  A Planar Straight Line Graph (PSLG) is a set of vertices and segments.
  Segments are simply edges, whose endpoints are all vertices in the PSLG.
  Segments may intersect each other only at their endpoints.  The file
  format for PSLGs (.poly files) is described below.

  A constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) of a PSLG is similar to a
  Delaunay triangulation, but each PSLG segment is present as a single edge
  of the CDT.  (A constrained Delaunay triangulation is not truly a
  Delaunay triangulation, because some of its triangles might not be
  Delaunay.)  By definition, a CDT does not have any vertices other than
  those specified in the input PSLG.  Depending on context, a CDT might
  cover the convex hull of the PSLG, or it might cover only a segment-
  bounded region (e.g. a polygon).

  A conforming Delaunay triangulation of a PSLG is a triangulation in which
  each triangle is truly Delaunay, and each PSLG segment is represented by
  a linear contiguous sequence of edges of the triangulation.  New vertices
  (not part of the PSLG) may appear, and each input segment may have been
  subdivided into shorter edges (subsegments) by these additional vertices.
  The new vertices are frequently necessary to maintain the Delaunay
  property while ensuring that every segment is represented.

  A conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation (CCDT) of a PSLG is a
  triangulation of a PSLG whose triangles are constrained Delaunay.  New
  vertices may appear, and input segments may be subdivided into
  subsegments, but not to guarantee that segments are respected; rather, to
  improve the quality of the triangles.  The high-quality meshes produced
  by the -q switch are usually CCDTs, but can be made conforming Delaunay
  with the -D switch.

File Formats:

  All files may contain comments prefixed by the character &#39;#&#39;.  Vertices,
  triangles, edges, holes, and maximum area constraints must be numbered
  consecutively, starting from either 1 or 0.  Whichever you choose, all
  input files must be consistent; if the vertices are numbered from 1, so
  must be all other objects.  Triangle automatically detects your choice
  while reading the .node (or .poly) file.  (When calling Triangle from
  another program, use the -z switch if you wish to number objects from
  zero.)  Examples of these file formats are given below.

  .node files:
    First line:  &lt;# of vertices&gt; &lt;dimension (must be 2)&gt; &lt;# of attributes&gt;
                                           &lt;# of boundary markers (0 or 1)&gt;
    Remaining lines:  &lt;vertex #&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; [attributes] [boundary marker]

    The attributes, which are typically floating-point values of physical
    quantities (such as mass or conductivity) associated with the nodes of
    a finite element mesh, are copied unchanged to the output mesh.  If -q,
    -a, -u, -D, or -s is selected, each new Steiner point added to the mesh
    has attributes assigned to it by linear interpolation.

    If the fourth entry of the first line is `1&#39;, the last column of the
    remainder of the file is assumed to contain boundary markers.  Boundary
    markers are used to identify boundary vertices and vertices resting on
    PSLG segments; a complete description appears in a section below.  The
    .node file produced by Triangle contains boundary markers in the last
    column unless they are suppressed by the -B switch.

  .ele files:
    First line:  &lt;# of triangles&gt; &lt;nodes per triangle&gt; &lt;# of attributes&gt;
    Remaining lines:  &lt;triangle #&gt; &lt;node&gt; &lt;node&gt; &lt;node&gt; ... [attributes]

    Nodes are indices into the corresponding .node file.  The first three
    nodes are the corner vertices, and are listed in counterclockwise order
    around each triangle.  (The remaining nodes, if any, depend on the type
    of finite element used.)

    The attributes are just like those of .node files.  Because there is no
    simple mapping from input to output triangles, Triangle attempts to
    interpolate attributes, and may cause a lot of diffusion of attributes
    among nearby triangles as the triangulation is refined.  Attributes do
    not diffuse across segments, so attributes used to identify
    segment-bounded regions remain intact.

    In .ele files produced by Triangle, each triangular element has three
    nodes (vertices) unless the -o2 switch is used, in which case
    subparametric quadratic elements with six nodes each are generated.
    The first three nodes are the corners in counterclockwise order, and
    the fourth, fifth, and sixth nodes lie on the midpoints of the edges
    opposite the first, second, and third vertices, respectively.

  .poly files:
    First line:  &lt;# of vertices&gt; &lt;dimension (must be 2)&gt; &lt;# of attributes&gt;
                                           &lt;# of boundary markers (0 or 1)&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;vertex #&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; [attributes] [boundary marker]
    One line:  &lt;# of segments&gt; &lt;# of boundary markers (0 or 1)&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;segment #&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; [boundary marker]
    One line:  &lt;# of holes&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;hole #&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;
    Optional line:  &lt;# of regional attributes and/or area constraints&gt;
    Optional following lines:  &lt;region #&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;max area&gt;

    A .poly file represents a PSLG, as well as some additional information.
    The first section lists all the vertices, and is identical to the
    format of .node files.  &lt;# of vertices&gt; may be set to zero to indicate
    that the vertices are listed in a separate .node file; .poly files
    produced by Triangle always have this format.  A vertex set represented
    this way has the advantage that it may easily be triangulated with or
    without segments (depending on whether the -p switch is invoked).

    The second section lists the segments.  Segments are edges whose
    presence in the triangulation is enforced.  (Depending on the choice of
    switches, segment might be subdivided into smaller edges).  Each
    segment is specified by listing the indices of its two endpoints.  This
    means that you must include its endpoints in the vertex list.  Each
    segment, like each point, may have a boundary marker.

    If -q, -a, -u, and -s are not selected, Triangle produces a constrained
    Delaunay triangulation (CDT), in which each segment appears as a single
    edge in the triangulation.  If -q, -a, -u, or -s is selected, Triangle
    produces a conforming constrained Delaunay triangulation (CCDT), in
    which segments may be subdivided into smaller edges.  If -D is
    selected, Triangle produces a conforming Delaunay triangulation, so
    that every triangle is Delaunay, and not just constrained Delaunay.

    The third section lists holes (and concavities, if -c is selected) in
    the triangulation.  Holes are specified by identifying a point inside
    each hole.  After the triangulation is formed, Triangle creates holes
    by eating triangles, spreading out from each hole point until its
    progress is blocked by segments in the PSLG.  You must be careful to
    enclose each hole in segments, or your whole triangulation might be
    eaten away.  If the two triangles abutting a segment are eaten, the
    segment itself is also eaten.  Do not place a hole directly on a
    segment; if you do, Triangle chooses one side of the segment
    arbitrarily.

    The optional fourth section lists regional attributes (to be assigned
    to all triangles in a region) and regional constraints on the maximum
    triangle area.  Triangle reads this section only if the -A switch is
    used or the -a switch is used without a number following it, and the -r
    switch is not used.  Regional attributes and area constraints are
    propagated in the same manner as holes:  you specify a point for each
    attribute and/or constraint, and the attribute and/or constraint
    affects the whole region (bounded by segments) containing the point.
    If two values are written on a line after the x and y coordinate, the
    first such value is assumed to be a regional attribute (but is only
    applied if the -A switch is selected), and the second value is assumed
    to be a regional area constraint (but is only applied if the -a switch
    is selected).  You may specify just one value after the coordinates,
    which can serve as both an attribute and an area constraint, depending
    on the choice of switches.  If you are using the -A and -a switches
    simultaneously and wish to assign an attribute to some region without
    imposing an area constraint, use a negative maximum area.

    When a triangulation is created from a .poly file, you must either
    enclose the entire region to be triangulated in PSLG segments, or
    use the -c switch, which automatically creates extra segments that
    enclose the convex hull of the PSLG.  If you do not use the -c switch,
    Triangle eats all triangles that are not enclosed by segments; if you
    are not careful, your whole triangulation may be eaten away.  If you do
    use the -c switch, you can still produce concavities by the appropriate
    placement of holes just inside the boundary of the convex hull.

    An ideal PSLG has no intersecting segments, nor any vertices that lie
    upon segments (except, of course, the endpoints of each segment).  You
    aren&#39;t required to make your .poly files ideal, but you should be aware
    of what can go wrong.  Segment intersections are relatively safe--
    Triangle calculates the intersection points for you and adds them to
    the triangulation--as long as your machine&#39;s floating-point precision
    doesn&#39;t become a problem.  You are tempting the fates if you have three
    segments that cross at the same location, and expect Triangle to figure
    out where the intersection point is.  Thanks to floating-point roundoff
    error, Triangle will probably decide that the three segments intersect
    at three different points, and you will find a minuscule triangle in
    your output--unless Triangle tries to refine the tiny triangle, uses
    up the last bit of machine precision, and fails to terminate at all.
    You&#39;re better off putting the intersection point in the input files,
    and manually breaking up each segment into two.  Similarly, if you
    place a vertex at the middle of a segment, and hope that Triangle will
    break up the segment at that vertex, you might get lucky.  On the other
    hand, Triangle might decide that the vertex doesn&#39;t lie precisely on
    the segment, and you&#39;ll have a needle-sharp triangle in your output--or
    a lot of tiny triangles if you&#39;re generating a quality mesh.

    When Triangle reads a .poly file, it also writes a .poly file, which
    includes all the subsegments--the edges that are parts of input
    segments.  If the -c switch is used, the output .poly file also
    includes all of the edges on the convex hull.  Hence, the output .poly
    file is useful for finding edges associated with input segments and for
    setting boundary conditions in finite element simulations.  Moreover,
    you will need the output .poly file if you plan to refine the output
    mesh, and don&#39;t want segments to be missing in later triangulations.

  .area files:
    First line:  &lt;# of triangles&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;triangle #&gt; &lt;maximum area&gt;

    An .area file associates with each triangle a maximum area that is used
    for mesh refinement.  As with other file formats, every triangle must
    be represented, and the triangles must be numbered consecutively.  A
    triangle may be left unconstrained by assigning it a negative maximum
    area.

  .edge files:
    First line:  &lt;# of edges&gt; &lt;# of boundary markers (0 or 1)&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;edge #&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; [boundary marker]

    Endpoints are indices into the corresponding .node file.  Triangle can
    produce .edge files (use the -e switch), but cannot read them.  The
    optional column of boundary markers is suppressed by the -B switch.

    In Voronoi diagrams, one also finds a special kind of edge that is an
    infinite ray with only one endpoint.  For these edges, a different
    format is used:

        &lt;edge #&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; -1 &lt;direction x&gt; &lt;direction y&gt;

    The `direction&#39; is a floating-point vector that indicates the direction
    of the infinite ray.

  .neigh files:
    First line:  &lt;# of triangles&gt; &lt;# of neighbors per triangle (always 3)&gt;
    Following lines:  &lt;triangle #&gt; &lt;neighbor&gt; &lt;neighbor&gt; &lt;neighbor&gt;

    Neighbors are indices into the corresponding .ele file.  An index of -1
    indicates no neighbor (because the triangle is on an exterior
    boundary).  The first neighbor of triangle i is opposite the first
    corner of triangle i, and so on.

    Triangle can produce .neigh files (use the -n switch), but cannot read
    them.

Boundary Markers:

  Boundary markers are tags used mainly to identify which output vertices
  and edges are associated with which PSLG segment, and to identify which
  vertices and edges occur on a boundary of the triangulation.  A common
  use is to determine where boundary conditions should be applied to a
  finite element mesh.  You can prevent boundary markers from being written
  into files produced by Triangle by using the -B switch.

  The boundary marker associated with each segment in an output .poly file
  and each edge in an output .edge file is chosen as follows:
    - If an output edge is part or all of a PSLG segment with a nonzero
      boundary marker, then the edge is assigned the same marker.
    - Otherwise, if the edge lies on a boundary of the triangulation
      (even the boundary of a hole), then the edge is assigned the marker
      one (1).
    - Otherwise, the edge is assigned the marker zero (0).
  The boundary marker associated with each vertex in an output .node file
  is chosen as follows:
    - If a vertex is assigned a nonzero boundary marker in the input file,
      then it is assigned the same marker in the output .node file.
    - Otherwise, if the vertex lies on a PSLG segment (even if it is an
      endpoint of the segment) with a nonzero boundary marker, then the
      vertex is assigned the same marker.  If the vertex lies on several
      such segments, one of the markers is chosen arbitrarily.
    - Otherwise, if the vertex occurs on a boundary of the triangulation,
      then the vertex is assigned the marker one (1).
    - Otherwise, the vertex is assigned the marker zero (0).

  If you want Triangle to determine for you which vertices and edges are on
  the boundary, assign them the boundary marker zero (or use no markers at
  all) in your input files.  In the output files, all boundary vertices,
  edges, and segments will be assigned the value one.

Triangulation Iteration Numbers:

  Because Triangle can read and refine its own triangulations, input
  and output files have iteration numbers.  For instance, Triangle might
  read the files mesh.3.node, mesh.3.ele, and mesh.3.poly, refine the
  triangulation, and output the files mesh.4.node, mesh.4.ele, and
  mesh.4.poly.  Files with no iteration number are treated as if
  their iteration number is zero; hence, Triangle might read the file
  points.node, triangulate it, and produce the files points.1.node and
  points.1.ele.

  Iteration numbers allow you to create a sequence of successively finer
  meshes suitable for multigrid methods.  They also allow you to produce a
  sequence of meshes using error estimate-driven mesh refinement.

  If you&#39;re not using refinement or quality meshing, and you don&#39;t like
  iteration numbers, use the -I switch to disable them.  This switch also
  disables output of .node and .poly files to prevent your input files from
  being overwritten.  (If the input is a .poly file that contains its own
  points, a .node file is written.  This can be quite convenient for
  computing CDTs or quality meshes.)

Examples of How to Use Triangle:

  `triangle dots&#39; reads vertices from dots.node, and writes their Delaunay
  triangulation to dots.1.node and dots.1.ele.  (dots.1.node is identical
  to dots.node.)  `triangle -I dots&#39; writes the triangulation to dots.ele
  instead.  (No additional .node file is needed, so none is written.)

  `triangle -pe object.1&#39; reads a PSLG from object.1.poly (and possibly
  object.1.node, if the vertices are omitted from object.1.poly) and writes
  its constrained Delaunay triangulation to object.2.node and object.2.ele.
  The segments are copied to object.2.poly, and all edges are written to
  object.2.edge.

  `triangle -pq31.5a.1 object&#39; reads a PSLG from object.poly (and possibly
  object.node), generates a mesh whose angles are all between 31.5 and 117
  degrees and whose triangles all have areas of 0.1 or less, and writes the
  mesh to object.1.node and object.1.ele.  Each segment may be broken up
  into multiple subsegments; these are written to object.1.poly.

  Here is a sample file `box.poly&#39; describing a square with a square hole:

    # A box with eight vertices in 2D, no attributes, one boundary marker.
    8 2 0 1
     # Outer box has these vertices:
     1   0 0   0
     2   0 3   0
     3   3 0   0
     4   3 3   33     # A special marker for this vertex.
     # Inner square has these vertices:
     5   1 1   0
     6   1 2   0
     7   2 1   0
     8   2 2   0
    # Five segments with boundary markers.
    5 1
     1   1 2   5      # Left side of outer box.
     # Square hole has these segments:
     2   5 7   0
     3   7 8   0
     4   8 6   10
     5   6 5   0
    # One hole in the middle of the inner square.
    1
     1   1.5 1.5

  Note that some segments are missing from the outer square, so you must
  use the `-c&#39; switch.  After `triangle -pqc box.poly&#39;, here is the output
  file `box.1.node&#39;, with twelve vertices.  The last four vertices were
  added to meet the angle constraint.  Vertices 1, 2, and 9 have markers
  from segment 1.  Vertices 6 and 8 have markers from segment 4.  All the
  other vertices but 4 have been marked to indicate that they lie on a
  boundary.

Refinement and Area Constraints:

  The -r switch causes a mesh (.node and .ele files) to be read and
  refined.  If the -p switch is also used, a .poly file is read and used to
  specify edges that are constrained and cannot be eliminated (although
  they can be subdivided into smaller edges) by the refinement process.

  When you refine a mesh, you generally want to impose tighter constraints.
  One way to accomplish this is to use -q with a larger angle, or -a
  followed by a smaller area than you used to generate the mesh you are
  refining.  Another way to do this is to create an .area file, which
  specifies a maximum area for each triangle, and use the -a switch
  (without a number following).  Each triangle&#39;s area constraint is applied
  to that triangle.  Area constraints tend to diffuse as the mesh is
  refined, so if there are large variations in area constraint between
  adjacent triangles, you may not get the results you want.  In that case,
  consider instead using the -u switch and writing a C procedure that
  determines which triangles are too large.

  If you are refining a mesh composed of linear (three-node) elements, the
  output mesh contains all the nodes present in the input mesh, in the same
  order, with new nodes added at the end of the .node file.  However, the
  refinement is not hierarchical: there is no guarantee that each output
  element is contained in a single input element.  Often, an output element
  can overlap two or three input elements, and some input edges are not
  present in the output mesh.  Hence, a sequence of refined meshes forms a
  hierarchy of nodes, but not a hierarchy of elements.  If you refine a
  mesh of higher-order elements, the hierarchical property applies only to
  the nodes at the corners of an element; the midpoint nodes on each edge
  are discarded before the mesh is refined.

  Maximum area constraints in .poly files operate differently from those in
  .area files.  A maximum area in a .poly file applies to the whole
  (segment-bounded) region in which a point falls, whereas a maximum area
  in an .area file applies to only one triangle.  Area constraints in .poly
  files are used only when a mesh is first generated, whereas area
  constraints in .area files are used only to refine an existing mesh, and
  are typically based on a posteriori error estimates resulting from a
  finite element simulation on that mesh.

  `triangle -rq25 object.1&#39; reads object.1.node and object.1.ele, then
  refines the triangulation to enforce a 25 degree minimum angle, and then
  writes the refined triangulation to object.2.node and object.2.ele.

  `triangle -rpaa6.2 z.3&#39; reads z.3.node, z.3.ele, z.3.poly, and z.3.area.
  After reconstructing the mesh and its subsegments, Triangle refines the
  mesh so that no triangle has area greater than 6.2, and furthermore the
  triangles satisfy the maximum area constraints in z.3.area.  No angle
  bound is imposed at all.  The output is written to z.4.node, z.4.ele, and
  z.4.poly.

  The sequence `triangle -qa1 x&#39;, `triangle -rqa.3 x.1&#39;, `triangle -rqa.1
  x.2&#39; creates a sequence of successively finer meshes x.1, x.2, and x.3,
  suitable for multigrid.

Convex Hulls and Mesh Boundaries:

  If the input is a vertex set (not a PSLG), Triangle produces its convex
  hull as a by-product in the output .poly file if you use the -c switch.
  There are faster algorithms for finding a two-dimensional convex hull
  than triangulation, of course, but this one comes for free.

  If the input is an unconstrained mesh (you are using the -r switch but
  not the -p switch), Triangle produces a list of its boundary edges
  (including hole boundaries) as a by-product when you use the -c switch.
  If you also use the -p switch, the output .poly file contains all the
  segments from the input .poly file as well.

Voronoi Diagrams:

  The -v switch produces a Voronoi diagram, in files suffixed .v.node and
  .v.edge.  For example, `triangle -v points&#39; reads points.node, produces
  its Delaunay triangulation in points.1.node and points.1.ele, and
  produces its Voronoi diagram in points.1.v.node and points.1.v.edge.  The
  .v.node file contains a list of all Voronoi vertices, and the .v.edge
  file contains a list of all Voronoi edges, some of which may be infinite
  rays.  (The choice of filenames makes it easy to run the set of Voronoi
  vertices through Triangle, if so desired.)

  This implementation does not use exact arithmetic to compute the Voronoi
  vertices, and does not check whether neighboring vertices are identical.
  Be forewarned that if the Delaunay triangulation is degenerate or
  near-degenerate, the Voronoi diagram may have duplicate vertices or
  crossing edges.

  The result is a valid Voronoi diagram only if Triangle&#39;s output is a true
  Delaunay triangulation.  The Voronoi output is usually meaningless (and
  may contain crossing edges and other pathology) if the output is a CDT or
  CCDT, or if it has holes or concavities.  If the triangulated domain is
  convex and has no holes, you can use -D switch to force Triangle to
  construct a conforming Delaunay triangulation instead of a CCDT, so the
  Voronoi diagram will be valid.

Mesh Topology:

  You may wish to know which triangles are adjacent to a certain Delaunay
  edge in an .edge file, which Voronoi cells are adjacent to a certain
  Voronoi edge in a .v.edge file, or which Voronoi cells are adjacent to
  each other.  All of this information can be found by cross-referencing
  output files with the recollection that the Delaunay triangulation and
  the Voronoi diagram are planar duals.

  Specifically, edge i of an .edge file is the dual of Voronoi edge i of
  the corresponding .v.edge file, and is rotated 90 degrees counterclock-
  wise from the Voronoi edge.  Triangle j of an .ele file is the dual of
  vertex j of the corresponding .v.node file.  Voronoi cell k is the dual
  of vertex k of the corresponding .node file.

  Hence, to find the triangles adjacent to a Delaunay edge, look at the
  vertices of the corresponding Voronoi edge.  If the endpoints of a
  Voronoi edge are Voronoi vertices 2 and 6 respectively, then triangles 2
  and 6 adjoin the left and right sides of the corresponding Delaunay edge,
  respectively.  To find the Voronoi cells adjacent to a Voronoi edge, look
  at the endpoints of the corresponding Delaunay edge.  If the endpoints of
  a Delaunay edge are input vertices 7 and 12, then Voronoi cells 7 and 12
  adjoin the right and left sides of the corresponding Voronoi edge,
  respectively.  To find which Voronoi cells are adjacent to each other,
  just read the list of Delaunay edges.

  Triangle does not write a list of the edges adjoining each Voronoi cell,
  but you can reconstructed it straightforwardly.  For instance, to find
  all the edges of Voronoi cell 1, search the output .edge file for every
  edge that has input vertex 1 as an endpoint.  The corresponding dual
  edges in the output .v.edge file form the boundary of Voronoi cell 1.

  For each Voronoi vertex, the .neigh file gives a list of the three
  Voronoi vertices attached to it.  You might find this more convenient
  than the .v.edge file.

Quadratic Elements:

  Triangle generates meshes with subparametric quadratic elements if the
  -o2 switch is specified.  Quadratic elements have six nodes per element,
  rather than three.  `Subparametric&#39; means that the edges of the triangles
  are always straight, so that subparametric quadratic elements are
  geometrically identical to linear elements, even though they can be used
  with quadratic interpolating functions.  The three extra nodes of an
  element fall at the midpoints of the three edges, with the fourth, fifth,
  and sixth nodes appearing opposite the first, second, and third corners
  respectively.

Domains with Small Angles:

  If two input segments adjoin each other at a small angle, clearly the -q
  switch cannot remove the small angle.  Moreover, Triangle may have no
  choice but to generate additional triangles whose smallest angles are
  smaller than the specified bound.  However, these triangles only appear
  between input segments separated by small angles.  Moreover, if you
  request a minimum angle of theta degrees, Triangle will generally produce
  no angle larger than 180 - 2 theta, even if it is forced to compromise on
  the minimum angle.

Statistics:

  After generating a mesh, Triangle prints a count of entities in the
  output mesh, including the number of vertices, triangles, edges, exterior
  boundary edges (i.e. subsegments on the boundary of the triangulation,
  including hole boundaries), interior boundary edges (i.e. subsegments of
  input segments not on the boundary), and total subsegments.  If you&#39;ve
  forgotten the statistics for an existing mesh, run Triangle on that mesh
  with the -rNEP switches to read the mesh and print the statistics without
  writing any files.  Use -rpNEP if you&#39;ve got a .poly file for the mesh.

  The -V switch produces extended statistics, including a rough estimate
  of memory use, the number of calls to geometric predicates, and
  histograms of the angles and the aspect ratios of the triangles in the
  mesh.

Exact Arithmetic:

  Triangle uses adaptive exact arithmetic to perform what computational
  geometers call the `orientation&#39; and `incircle&#39; tests.  If the floating-
  point arithmetic of your machine conforms to the IEEE 754 standard (as
  most workstations do), and does not use extended precision internal
  floating-point registers, then your output is guaranteed to be an
  absolutely true Delaunay or constrained Delaunay triangulation, roundoff
  error notwithstanding.  The word `adaptive&#39; implies that these arithmetic
  routines compute the result only to the precision necessary to guarantee
  correctness, so they are usually nearly as fast as their approximate
  counterparts.

  May CPUs, including Intel x86 processors, have extended precision
  floating-point registers.  These must be reconfigured so their precision
  is reduced to memory precision.  Triangle does this if it is compiled
  correctly.  See the makefile for details.

  The exact tests can be disabled with the -X switch.  On most inputs, this
  switch reduces the computation time by about eight percent--it&#39;s not
  worth the risk.  There are rare difficult inputs (having many collinear
  and cocircular vertices), however, for which the difference in speed
  could be a factor of two.  Be forewarned that these are precisely the
  inputs most likely to cause errors if you use the -X switch.  Hence, the
  -X switch is not recommended.

  Unfortunately, the exact tests don&#39;t solve every numerical problem.
  Exact arithmetic is not used to compute the positions of new vertices,
  because the bit complexity of vertex coordinates would grow without
  bound.  Hence, segment intersections aren&#39;t computed exactly; in very
  unusual cases, roundoff error in computing an intersection point might
  actually lead to an inverted triangle and an invalid triangulation.
  (This is one reason to specify your own intersection points in your .poly
  files.)  Similarly, exact arithmetic is not used to compute the vertices
  of the Voronoi diagram.

  Another pair of problems not solved by the exact arithmetic routines is
  underflow and overflow.  If Triangle is compiled for double precision
  arithmetic, I believe that Triangle&#39;s geometric predicates work correctly
  if the exponent of every input coordinate falls in the range [-148, 201].
  Underflow can silently prevent the orientation and incircle tests from
  being performed exactly, while overflow typically causes a floating
  exception.

Troubleshooting:

  Please read this section before mailing me bugs.

  `My output mesh has no triangles!&#39;

    If you&#39;re using a PSLG, you&#39;ve probably failed to specify a proper set
    of bounding segments, or forgotten to use the -c switch.  Or you may
    have placed a hole badly, thereby eating all your triangles.  To test
    these possibilities, try again with the -c and -O switches.
    Alternatively, all your input vertices may be collinear, in which case
    you can hardly expect to triangulate them.

  `Triangle doesn&#39;t terminate, or just crashes.&#39;

    Bad things can happen when triangles get so small that the distance
    between their vertices isn&#39;t much larger than the precision of your
    machine&#39;s arithmetic.  If you&#39;ve compiled Triangle for single-precision
    arithmetic, you might do better by recompiling it for double-precision.
    Then again, you might just have to settle for more lenient constraints
    on the minimum angle and the maximum area than you had planned.

    You can minimize precision problems by ensuring that the origin lies
    inside your vertex set, or even inside the densest part of your
    mesh.  If you&#39;re triangulating an object whose x-coordinates all fall
    between 6247133 and 6247134, you&#39;re not leaving much floating-point
    precision for Triangle to work with.

    Precision problems can occur covertly if the input PSLG contains two
    segments that meet (or intersect) at an extremely small angle, or if
    such an angle is introduced by the -c switch.  If you don&#39;t realize
    that a tiny angle is being formed, you might never discover why
    Triangle is crashing.  To check for this possibility, use the -S switch
    (with an appropriate limit on the number of Steiner points, found by
    trial-and-error) to stop Triangle early, and view the output .poly file
    with Show Me (described below).  Look carefully for regions where dense
    clusters of vertices are forming and for small angles between segments.
    Zoom in closely, as such segments might look like a single segment from
    a distance.

    If some of the input values are too large, Triangle may suffer a
    floating exception due to overflow when attempting to perform an
    orientation or incircle test.  (Read the section on exact arithmetic
    above.)  Again, I recommend compiling Triangle for double (rather
    than single) precision arithmetic.

    Unexpected problems can arise if you use quality meshing (-q, -a, or
    -u) with an input that is not segment-bounded--that is, if your input
    is a vertex set, or you&#39;re using the -c switch.  If the convex hull of
    your input vertices has collinear vertices on its boundary, an input
    vertex that you think lies on the convex hull might actually lie just
    inside the convex hull.  If so, the vertex and the nearby convex hull
    edge form an extremely thin triangle.  When Triangle tries to refine
    the mesh to enforce angle and area constraints, Triangle might generate
    extremely tiny triangles, or it might fail because of insufficient
    floating-point precision.

  `The numbering of the output vertices doesn&#39;t match the input vertices.&#39;

    You may have had duplicate input vertices, or you may have eaten some
    of your input vertices with a hole, or by placing them outside the area
    enclosed by segments.  In any case, you can solve the problem by not
    using the -j switch.

  `Triangle executes without incident, but when I look at the resulting
  mesh, it has overlapping triangles or other geometric inconsistencies.&#39;

    If you select the -X switch, Triangle occasionally makes mistakes due
    to floating-point roundoff error.  Although these errors are rare,
    don&#39;t use the -X switch.  If you still have problems, please report the
    bug.

  `Triangle executes without incident, but when I look at the resulting
  Voronoi diagram, it has overlapping edges or other geometric
  inconsistencies.&#39;

    If your input is a PSLG (-p), you can only expect a meaningful Voronoi
    diagram if the domain you are triangulating is convex and free of
    holes, and you use the -D switch to construct a conforming Delaunay
    triangulation (instead of a CDT or CCDT).

  Strange things can happen if you&#39;ve taken liberties with your PSLG.  Do
  you have a vertex lying in the middle of a segment?  Triangle sometimes
  copes poorly with that sort of thing.  Do you want to lay out a collinear
  row of evenly spaced, segment-connected vertices?  Have you simply
  defined one long segment connecting the leftmost vertex to the rightmost
  vertex, and a bunch of vertices lying along it?  This method occasionally
  works, especially with horizontal and vertical lines, but often it
  doesn&#39;t, and you&#39;ll have to connect each adjacent pair of vertices with a
  separate segment.  If you don&#39;t like it, tough.

  Furthermore, if you have segments that intersect other than at their
  endpoints, try not to let the intersections fall extremely close to PSLG
  vertices or each other.

  If you have problems refining a triangulation not produced by Triangle:
  Are you sure the triangulation is geometrically valid?  Is it formatted
  correctly for Triangle?  Are the triangles all listed so the first three
  vertices are their corners in counterclockwise order?  Are all of the
  triangles constrained Delaunay?  Triangle&#39;s Delaunay refinement algorithm
  assumes that it starts with a CDT.

Show Me:

  Triangle comes with a separate program named `Show Me&#39;, whose primary
  purpose is to draw meshes on your screen or in PostScript.  Its secondary
  purpose is to check the validity of your input files, and do so more
  thoroughly than Triangle does.  Unlike Triangle, Show Me requires that
  you have the X Windows system.  Sorry, Microsoft Windows users.

A Brief Plea:

  If you use Triangle, and especially if you use it to accomplish real
  work, I would like very much to hear from you.  A short letter or email
  (to jrs@cs.berkeley.edu) describing how you use Triangle will mean a lot
  to me.  The more people I know are using this program, the more easily I
  can justify spending time on improvements, which in turn will benefit
  you.  Also, I can put you on a list to receive email whenever a new
  version of Triangle is available.

  If you use a mesh generated by Triangle in a publication, please include
  an acknowledgment as well.  And please spell Triangle with a capital `T&#39;!
  If you want to include a citation, use `Jonathan Richard Shewchuk,

Research credit:

  Of course, I can take credit for only a fraction of the ideas that made
  this mesh generator possible.  Triangle owes its existence to the efforts
  of many fine computational geometers and other researchers, including
